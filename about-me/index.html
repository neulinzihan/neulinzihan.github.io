    <h1>more about me</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">the unfiltered version</p>

    <h2>what drives me</h2>
    <p><span class="hl">Raspberry Pi</span> is where my curiosity lives — it's my go-to platform for exploring AI algorithms, reinforcement learning, the latest Python developments, sensor drivers, and even new eco-friendly battery materials. I also genuinely enjoy revisiting and digging deeper into control systems, vibration propagation control, thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and material science (especially stainless steel).</p>

    <h2>hands-on by nature</h2>
    <p>I love <span class="hl">DIY car repair</span> — oil changes, hub assembly replacements, clutch/brake oil system work — and I own nearly enough tools to take apart an entire car. I also fix bikes, phones, and computers. I'm currently working toward my <span class="hl">SolidWorks certification (CSWA)</span>. Areas I'm eager to explore next include <span class="hl">AGV, multi-agent system design, and AR</span>.</p>

    <h2>how I learn</h2>
    <p>I'll be honest — <span class="hl">short-form video</span> is my favorite way to absorb information and find inspiration. Whether it's WeChat Video, Douyin, TikTok, or YouTube Shorts, when something sparks an idea, I immediately capture it in a properly formatted note in <span class="hl">Obsidian (Markdown)</span>. Or I'll ask AI right away — having AI as a learning companion lets me dive deep into any topic continuously. I also regularly add textbooks and classic publications to my digital bookshelf from online libraries.</p>

    <h2>beyond engineering</h2>
    <p>I play <span class="hl">violin</span> (pop and gospel music), love being in nature through hiking and outdoor living, and stay active with <span class="hl">basketball</span> (handles and flashy passes), skiing, tennis, skateboarding, and golf. I enjoy MOBA games, American TV series, and <span class="hl">cooking</span> — especially stir-fry and charcoal grilling. I'm drawn to a healthy, minimalist lifestyle.</p>
    <p>I'm fascinated by art, ancient and modern history (both Eastern and Western), comparative literature and wisdom across cultures, <span class="hl">biblical theology, apologetics</span>, public speaking, communication styles for different contexts, classical Chinese prose and poetry, personal growth, emotional problem-solving, and joyful parenting and education.</p>
    <p>Some things I want to start learning: <span class="hl">photography, dancing, drums/piano, gas bike and car modification, music production, and sales techniques</span>.</p>
    <p>I also have ideas for novel product designs — particularly in <span class="hl">pet tech and assistive technology</span> — spanning business models to hardware/software design. I've raised chickens, turtles, and tropical fish since elementary school, and co-raised two cats with roommates.</p>

    <h2>how I think</h2>
    <p>My preferred note-taking order: <span class="hl">paper > stylus/tablet > keyboard</span>. Exploring new hobbies is how I recharge and stay curious. Learning a new language is what motivates me socially.</p>

    <h2>what I watch</h2>
    <p>Stand-up comedy (Trevor Noah), interview-style documentaries and talk shows (Jiang Wen, Dou Wentao, Xu Zhiyuan, Ellen), and updating this very website.</p>

    <p style="color:var(--text3); margin-top:40px; font-style:italic;">My deepest hope is that everyone I meet feels happy and safe.</p>
