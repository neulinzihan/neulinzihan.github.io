## Abstract

A spherical inclusion is embedded in a soft gel block. A vertical force is applied on the gel surface by means of a spherical indenter. The loading axis is not aligned with the inclusion but placed at a horizontal offset displacement from the inclusion. The measurement of indentation force and inclusion trajectory are compared to the computational results from two-dimensional (2D) Finite Element Analysis (FEA) simulations. A discernible instability emerges when the indentation reaches a critical depth, in accordance with the Southwell instability theory. The three-dimensional (3D) trajectory shows distinct features that were previously not captured by the 2D FEA simulations.
