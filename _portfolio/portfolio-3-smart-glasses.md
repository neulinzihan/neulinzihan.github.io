## Overview

A real-time obstacle detection and tactile feedback system utilizing an Arducam Time-of-Flight (ToF) depth camera integrated with vibration motors, designed to enhance spatial awareness for visually impaired users.

## Abstract

The smart glasses present a real-time obstacle detection and tactile feedback system utilizing an Arducam Time-of-Flight (ToF) depth camera integrated with vibration motors. The system is designed to enhance spatial awareness by detecting obstacles within predefined regions of interest (ROIs) and providing corresponding tactile alerts.

## Key Features

- Depth data processing to identify minimum distance of objects within left, middle, and right ROIs
- Vibration motors actuated with varying frequencies based on object proximity
- Closer obstacles trigger higher vibration frequencies for intuitive feedback
- Optimized sensor performance through depth noise filtering

## Technical Implementation

- **Hardware**: Raspberry Pi, Arducam ToF Camera, Vibration Motors
- **Software**: Python, OpenCV
- **Fabrication**: 3D Printed enclosure

## Technical Skills

Raspberry Pi, Python, 3D Printing, ToF Camera, Signal Processing
