## Overview

Conducted three laboratory projects in materials characterization and mechanical testing as part of ME 2340/2341 coursework.

---

## Project 1: Material Identification using XRD

- Identified unknown metals using X-Ray Diffraction analysis
- Applied Bragg's Law with **<0.5% error**
- Determined crystal structures (FCC for Aluminum, BCC for Iron)
- Validated results against JCPDS database

---

## Project 2: Quantitative Metallography of Cu-Zn Brass

- Performed sample preparation (grinding, polishing, etching)
- Used LAS Phase Expert for image analysis
- Determined phase composition through quantitative analysis
- Analyzed heat-treated steel samples (Pearlite vs. Martensite)

---

## Project 3: Mechanical Property Testing

- Conducted Rockwell hardness testing
- Performed Charpy impact testing at various temperatures (-200°C to 200°C)
- Analyzed Ductile-Brittle Transition Temperature (DBTT)
- Provided material selection recommendations

## Technical Skills

XRD Analysis, Metallography, Optical Microscopy, Hardness Testing, Impact Testing, Phase Diagrams
