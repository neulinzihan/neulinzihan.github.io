## Overview

An AI-driven framework for deploying autonomous drones equipped with LTE relays to provide emergency network coverage and assist in locating survivors after natural disasters.

## Abstract

In the aftermath of natural disasters, rapid restoration of communication networks is crucial for effective relief operations. This paper presents an AI-driven framework for deploying autonomous drones equipped with LTE relays to provide emergency network coverage and assist in locating survivors.

## Key Contributions

- Implemented **Q-learning model** to dynamically determine optimal drone placements based on coverage area
- Developed **A* pathfinding algorithm** to guide emergency vehicles to target locations while avoiding obstacles
- Achieved **100% area coverage** with only 4 drones, outperforming PPO and MCTS baselines
- Verified convergence over **20,000+ training episodes**

## Results

Simulation results demonstrate that this integrated approach significantly improves coverage area and provides a quick path to the target position. The proposed system offers a scalable solution for intelligent, drone-based disaster response.

## Technical Skills

Python, Q-Learning, Reinforcement Learning, A* Pathfinding, Proximal Policy Optimization
