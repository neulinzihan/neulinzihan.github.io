## Overview

Three comprehensive FEA projects covering biomechanics, composite materials, and industrial applications.

---

## Project 1: Biomechanical Analysis of Human Femur Bone

- Developed MATLAB FEA program using 1D bar elements to model femur bone
- Used variable cross-sectional area from CT-scan data
- Performed mesh convergence study (1-100 elements)
- Estimated elastic modulus (E) using optimization techniques (fminsearch)
- Analyzed stress distribution to identify critical failure locations

---

## Project 2: Composite Material Microstructure Analysis

- Built 2D truss FEA solver in MATLAB (2000 nodes, 5800+ elements)
- Compared mechanical responses of isotropic vs. anisotropic fiber networks
- Simulated progressive crack propagation by removing failed elements (>10.5 MPa threshold)
- Analyzed microstructural architecture effects on material anisotropy

## Project 3: Engine Block Stress Analysis

- Created 3D CAD model of engine cylinder block in SolidWorks
- Performed static structural analysis in ANSYS Workbench (750 psi internal pressure)
- Conducted mesh convergence study
- Verified maximum stress (89.67 MPa) remained below yield strength (241 MPa)
